The only chance of not making a collision is if all the ants move in the same direction

Given that each ant can move in two direction only there will be 2^3 = 8 different possibilities.
0 = ANTi moves left 0 = ANTi moves right

ANT1 ANT2 ANT3
  0    0    0
  0    0    1
  0    1    0
  0    1    1
  1    0    0
  1    0    1
  1    1    0
  1    1    1

Given that all of the possibilities are equally likely to happen, we can apply we can apply Laplace's rule (favorable cases/total cases).

In this case we see that only the first and last combination will lead to not have any collision between ants.

So, the probability of having any collision c is:

P(c) = 6/8 = 3/4 (0.75)

Following the same reasoning for a n vertex polygon with n ants in any vertex.

P(c) = (2^n-2)/2^n
